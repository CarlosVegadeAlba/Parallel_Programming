#### In this repository you would find information about Parallel programming, such as theorical explanations in Summary.pdf and 3 different assigments where some different algorithms would be studied

## First Assigment

#### First We will study the Radix algorithm

## Second Assigment

#### Then We will study the BFS algorithm in different graphs

## Thrid Assigment
